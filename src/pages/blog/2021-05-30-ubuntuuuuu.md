description: This treatise differs from the ordinary compendium mainly in its
  method of procedure. It must be understood at the outset that the philosophic
  way of advancing from one matter to another, the general speculative method,
  which is the only kind of scientific proof available in philosophy, is
  essentially different from every other. Only a clear insight into the
  necessity for this difference can snatch philosophy out of the ignominious
  condition into which it has fallen in our day. True, the logical rules, such
  as those of definition, classification, and inference are now generally
  recognised to be inadequate for speculative science. Perhaps it is nearer the
  mark to say that the inadequacy of the rules has been felt rather than
  recognised, because they have been counted as mere fetters, and thrown aside
  to make room for free speech from the heart, fancy and random intuition. But
  when reflection and relations of thought were required, people unconsciously
  fell back upon the old-fashioned method of inference and formal reasoning. In
  my Science of Logic I have developed the nature of speculative science in
  detail. Hence in this treatise an explanation of method will be added only
  here and there. In a work which is concrete, and presents such a diversity of
  phases, we may safely neglect to display at every turn the logical process,
  and may take for granted an acquaintance with the scientific procedure.
  Besides, it may readily be observed that the work as a whole, and also the
  construction of the parts, rest upon the logical spirit. From this standpoint,
  especially, is it that I would like this treatise to be understood and judged.
  In such a work as this we are dealing with a science, and in a science the
  matter must not be separated from the form.
